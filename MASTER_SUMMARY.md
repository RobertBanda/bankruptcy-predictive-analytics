2. ❌ **No Issue Tree diagram** → This is explicitly required
3. ❌ **No PDF report** → This is a separate deliverable
4. ❌ **Code doesn't run** → Test entire notebook
5. ❌ **Missing visualizations** → Must have 10+ figures
6. ❌ **Generic README** → Use the improved template
7. ❌ **Late submission** → Deadline is Sunday, February 1, 2026, 2:00 AM
